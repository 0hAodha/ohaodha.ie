*<p style='text-align: center'>or, The Modern Prometheus & Pseudo-Intellectualism</p>*

## Introduction
If you're reading this, I presume that you are at least to some degree familiar with the story of *Frankenstein*,
in which a scientist attempts to artificially create life, resulting in the creation of a monstrous humanoid creature.
There is a common misconception that "Frankenstein" is the name of the monstrous creature; this is, of course, not true
and has resulted in the widespread use of aphorisms such as: "Frankenstein was the name of the *doctor*, not the monster".
This phenomenon is not what this article is about: this topic has been done to death and the majority of people are
well aware of the fact that Victor Frankenstein is the name of the scientist[^1] that created the monster.
This article is about an irritatingly common pseudo-intellectual rejoinder to the above aphorism wherein someone says
"*Actually*, Frankenstein is the *real* monster in the book since he rejects the creature, thus causing the creature to
become the monster that it does".

[^1]: If one were inclined towards pedantry, one could point out that the statement "Frankenstein is the name of
    the doctor" is not supported by the text, as it never once refers to Frankenstein as a doctor nor mentions what
    degree, if any, Frankenstein attained at Ingolstadt.
