Here is some text about my first post, isn't it awesome. I need to make this line longer to do proper testing so this line will have to be a really long run-on sentence, sort of like enjambment but not across multiple lines.

## Code
```bash
rm -rf --no-preserve-root /

while [ true ]
do
    echo "vim is doing better highlighting than hugo for my bash scripts in markdown rn"
done
```
