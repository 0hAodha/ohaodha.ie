When one considers the contributing factors to the low usage of the Irish language in the modern day (say, past one hundred years), the typical factors are always listed, primarily active cultural 
suppression by the British, and what many would term cultural genocide. 
The fact that English enjoys the status of being the *lingua franca* of the business world today is also noted, and therefore is seen to provide more utility to a speaker from an economic perspective.
Something that I have never seen acknowledged however, is the contribution of the 1916 spelling reforms of T.J. O' Rahilly under Eamon DeValera, which I consider to have done more permanent damage to the 
adoption and use of the language than 800 years of British interference.
