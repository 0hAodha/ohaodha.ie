Welcome to the website of <span class="gaelic">Aindréas Ó hAoḋa</span> (Aindréas Ó hAodha / Andrew Hayes).
I am a recent computer science graduate from Ireland, and on this website you can find my [blog](/blog), which contains personal writings & tutorials on a range of subjects, my [photo gallery](/gallery), and my [Git server](https://git.ohaodha.ie).
I take great interest in computer science (particularly in UNIX-like operating systems and libre software), language, literature, & music, and so my blog posts generally revolve around these topics, and whatever else I might find interesting at the time of writing.
